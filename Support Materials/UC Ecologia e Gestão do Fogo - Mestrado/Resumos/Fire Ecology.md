#### Mediterranean-type Ecosystems
- Climate - long warm dry summers, cool moist winters with a pronounced summer dry period
- Physiography - Landscapes of eroded mountains, heterogeneous low-nutrient soils, and pulse-driven river systems.
- Plants - evergreen sclerophyllous shrubs very fire prone and with enough biomass to carry fire. Some display fire-cued seed germination.

	A plant community adapts to a fire regime, not climate, enhancing their **survival traits** and promoting **post-fire regeneration**


**Resistance** - ability to withstand or endure change when faced with a disturbance.
**Resilience** - ability to recover and return to a stable state following a disturbance.
If disturbances are too frequent the ecosystem may surpass a tipping point and not recover to its original state finding another stable state



### Survival enhancing characteristics (individual level resistance)

Species that habit **Refugia** (humid riparian areas, sparsely vegetated rock outcrops), that escape the fire's destruction, can provide seed sources for the re-establishment of burned areas.


**Hard seeds** increase fitness: 
- they increase seed longevity
- their dormancy is broken at high temperatures (like in a wildfire)
- then, they enable seeds to germinate quickly
- they ensure their survival in the digestive tract of animals
- they don't rot easily

The Germination may be **Delayed** until after a fire so there is:
- less competition for resources
- more fertile soil by the mineralisation of biomass
- more direct sunlight (it depends on the canopy's gaps)
**Pyroendemics/Fire ephemerals** - plants that only recruit after a fire 

Seed Dormancy may be broken by heat (**Heat-stimulated germination**) or smoke (**Smoke-stimulated germination**), although charred wood and other combustion products may also trigger this germination.

**Serotiny** (Cupressus spp. and Pinus spp.) is the retention of matured seeds in closed cones so that the seed dispersal is delayed until after fires, when the soil has cooled down. 
The heat of the fire acts as a cue to open the cones. 
As there is a synchrony of seed release, there is an increased seed survival
Canopy seed banks are less resilient to long fire intervals than are soil seed banks, which can remain viable for many decades after the plant dies. 

**Fire-stimulated flowering** - Profuse flowering after fire, when there are higher light levels, with limited flowering between fires.



**Hot-flammable strategy** - some plants increase reproductive success by enhancing their flammability, (ignitability and fire intensity) to promote their fire-stimulated germination.
- increased levels of standing dead biomass, 
- thinner twigs
- leaves with higher levels of volatile compounds,
- lower live-fuel moisture,
It also acts as a niche constructor by also changing their own environment by burning their neighbours (lower competition, and generational lower germination due to low resilience and adaptive traits).

**Flammability** depends on the fire regime, and the characteristics of plant structure, including retention of dead branches and chemical composition, as an example.


**Thick Bark** (Pinus spp. and Cork Oak) through the insulation of the trunk's cambium layer.

**Bud Width** influences the bud's resistance to heat

**Growth Rate**

**Self-pruning** of dead branches to produce a gap between surface fires and their canopies.



### Promotion of Post-Fire Regeneration (population-level resilience)

#### Postfire Resprouting (R)
Ability to generate new shoots from dormant buds after the stems have been fully scorched by fire.
- In the base of the canopy stems in the trunk - **Epicormic** resprouting 
- On belowground organs - Basal resprouting
	- **Lignotubers**, woody **Rhizomes**, **Roots** (woody species)
	- Bulbs, Corms, Tubers, Rhizomes (herbaceous species)
#### Post Fire Seeding/Recruitment stimulated by fire (S)
Ability to generate a fire-resistant seed bank with seeds that germinate profusely in a single pulse after fires (**Fire-cued Germination**). 


### Post Fire Strategies

##### Obligate Resprouters R+ S-
*Quercus ilex, Arbutus unedo*
Rely on vegetative resprouting to regenerate after fire (resprouters without postfire seeding ability) as they don't create a fire-resistent seed bank. 
They have a long lifespan that allows for higher NPP.
These are **iteroparous species** and have a **polypyric life cycle**.
##### Facultative Seeders/Resprouters R+ S+
*Eucalyptus globulus, Pterospartum tridentatum*
Plants that have both mechanisms for regenerating after fire, that is, they are able to resprout and to germinate after fire.
##### Obligate Seeders R- S+
*Pinus pinaster, Cistus spp.*
Plants that rely on long-lasting seeding to regenerate their population after fire (nonresprouters with postfire seeding ability), they only recruit once, massively, in their lifespan. 
Fire typically exhausts their seed bank so each individual must grow rapidly to replenish it, they are vulnerable to an increased fire frequency. 
These are **semelparous species** with nonoverlapping generations and a **monopyric life cycle**.
##### Fire Avoiders R- S- (Post Fire colonizers)
*Juniperus phoenicea*
Non-resprouters without fire-stimulated recruitment.
They recruit after fire by seeds dispersed from unburned patches or from populations outside the fire perimeter.

**Monopyric Life Cycle**: they perform all their life cycle within a fire cycle.
**Polypyric Life Cycle**: they perform all their life cycle through multiple fire cycles.

**Semelparous Species**: they have a single reproductive episode before death. 
**Iteroparous Species**: they have multiple reproductive cycles over the course of their lifetime.
