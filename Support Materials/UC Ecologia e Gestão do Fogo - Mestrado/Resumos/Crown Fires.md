Crown fires are intense, spread fast, and have damaging effects. The crown fires consume aerial fuel that are more moist and more porous than surface fuels.

Their behavior is more complex than that of surface fires, therefore crown fire danger assessment focuses on the estimation of their **probability of occurrence** and their **rate of spread in the crown layer**.

There are three types of crown fire:
- **Passive Crown Fire** - torching of individual trees, isolated or in small clusters, by a surface fire.
- **Active Crown Fire** - fire spreading continuously through the crown layer, involving the entire fuel complex. It is dependent on the heat influx from the surface fire to continue spreading.
- **Independent Crown Fire** - crown fire without an underlying surface fire. It requires a combination of strong wind, steep slope, and dense, severely dry tree crown foliage.

A surface fire can sometimes scorch leaves, not starting a crown fire and not increasing the fire's intensity.

The three key aerial fuel variables are:
- **Canopy layer bulk density** (CBD), is the amount of available crown fuel within a unit volume of the canopy. It is a ratio of canopy fuel load (CFL) to canopy depth.
- **Crown base height** (CBH), is the lowest height above which the aerial fuel bulk density is at least 0.011 kg/m3. It represents the likelihood of surface-to-crown fire transition
- **Foliar moisture content** (FMC), is a weighted average moisture content for the various needle ages found within the canopy fuel layer (needles decrease in moisture content with age). Crown fire potential is high whenever needle moisture drops below 100% of dry weight.
- (stand height)

The surface fire needs to release enough energy to dry out the crown foliage and raise its temperature to the ignition point to start an active crown fire. Is needed a greater surface fire intensity to ignite the tree crowns when FMC and CBH are higher.


Understory fuel model, crown base height (CBH), and crown bulk density (CBD) are the variables we can manipulate to manage fire danger.

To avoid a crown fire, and stop the surface-to-crown fire transition we should create **vertical discontinuities** in our forests by distancing the crown base height from the surface layer height. Somo trees self-prune in order to achieve this, without human intervention.

Forest stands with a lack of management tend to have a more close surface and crown layer (like *Pinus pinaster* stands, due to their longer term of exploration than *Eucalyptus globulus* stands, as an example) and therefore, that forest will be considered more fire prone. 

Cork Oak stands have low density (higher CI), therefore, there is more shrub growth and, because of the minimal competition, the trees tend to grow more horizontally and less vertically (lower TI). Resolving this paradox is a context- specific problem that depends on local/regional forest vegetation ecology, forest management goals, and overall fire danger.

Deciduous trees only have leaves from the current year so the leaves have higher moisture and the trees is less fire prone than evergreen ones.
