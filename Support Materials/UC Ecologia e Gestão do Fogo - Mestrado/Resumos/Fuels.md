#FEM 
A Fuel is any combustible plant material, all live and dead plant organic matter.

The Fuel is very important because it is the only part of the Fire Behaviour Triangle that can be managed.

### Potencial Fuel
Fuel present at a site that may burn in the most intense fire expectable, some fuel may not burn due to their Properties (humidity, thickness, topography and weather).


## Fuel Mosaic
The spatial pattern or arrangement of different types and amounts of fuel across a landscape. 

### Fuel Complex
The combination of all live and dead plant material, the fuels in an area, across all sizes and layers.

#### [[Fuel Layer Properties|Fuel Layer / Fuel Bed]]
A horizontal layer of fuel at a specific position in the vertical structure of vegetation, described by its **loading**, depth **and** **particle sizes**.
There are 3 fuel layers:
- Aerial/Canopy Fuels - Branches, Moss, Snags, Leaves, Vines
- Surface Fuels (within 2m) - Mosses, Peat, Bushed, Stumps, Litter
- Subsurface/Ground Fuels (more than 2m) - Roots, Duff, Litter

##### [[Fuel Particle Properties|Fuel Particle]]
The smallest unit of fuel, such as a leaf, twig, grass blade, or needle in a Fuel Layer. Fuel particles determine ignition and combustion rates, depending on their size, shape, moisture, and arrangement.



## Fuel Type
An identifiable association of fuel elements that will cause a predictable rate of fire spread or difficulty of control under specified weather conditions. The fuel types' characteristics can be
