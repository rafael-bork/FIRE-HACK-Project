### Fine Fuel Moisture Code

The FFMC is an **indicator of the receptivity of surface fuels to ignition** and has a strong influence on the **vigour of spread of a surface fire**.

A human-caused fire occurrence depends on the receptivity of forest fuels to ignition and sustainable spread as well as the number of ignition sources in the forest.

A Fine Fuel is a 1.2cm thick layer of pine litter  or dead woody fuels with a diameter of 0.6 - 2.5 cm, with a fuel weight of 0.25 kg/m2, 

**The drying rate is affected by the air temperature, the relative humidity, the wind speed and the rainfall.**

The FFMC's response time is approximately **0.5 days**.


### Duff Moisture Code

The Duff Moisture Code (DMC) indicates **how easily the loosely compacted organic layer** (duff) **below the surface can ignite and sustain smoldering combustion**.

The Duff is the top 7 cm of the forest floor with a fuel load of around 5 kg/m2.

The DMC layer gains moisture directly only from rainfall and dries to a constant equilibrium moisture content of 20%.

**Therefore, the drying rate is affected by the air temperature, the relative humidity and the rainfall.**

The DMC's response time is approximately **10 days**.


### Drought Code

The Drought Code (DC) measures the moisture content of the fuel on the surface and within the forest floor that could burn in long-lasting, deep-burning fires. It is aso an indicator of the **difficulty of mop-up of a fire**, that is, the difficulty in finally extinguishing all areas where the fire is smouldering. Their monthly mean and maximum are also good predictors of **area burned**.

The Drought Code tracks moisture in the 18 cm thick organic layer with a fuel load of 25 kg/m2

The DC layer gains moisture directly only from rainfall and dries to a constant equilibrium moisture content of 0%.

**Therefore, the drying rate is affected by the air temperature and the rainfall.**

The DC's response time is approximately **50 days**.


### Initial Spread Index

The Initial Spread Index (ISI) integrates the moisture content of surface fuels (FFMC) and the wind speed, to give an indicator of the **potential rate of spread** of a fire. The relation of the ISI to a Rate of Fire Speed is different for each forest type. It is used to assess the **need for prompt initial attack**.

### Built-Up Index 

The Build-Up Index (BUI) is an index used as a relative indicator of potential **fuel available for surface fuel consumption** that accounts for the moisture levels in the DMC and the DC fuel layers, under the form of a weighted mean of those two codes. 

It is also an  indicator of the **potential difficulty in extinguishing smouldering fire**, or the tendency of a fire to remain smouldering deep in the ground or in large woody material that is correlated to the **need of involving heavy aircraft** in the fire combat.


### Fire Weather Index

The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is a unitless indicator of **expected fire intensity** calculated through the product of the BUI (the fuel consumption indicator) and the ISI (the rate of spread indicator).

The FWI provides a general **summary of fire weather and fuel moisture in a region** and can be useful when a single **indicator of general fire potential** is needed, for instance when **communicating fire danger to the public**.


### Daily Severity Rating

The Daily Severity Rating (DSR) is a monotonic, non-linear transformation of FWI that more accurately reflects the **expected effort required for fire suppression**. Their monthly mean and maximum are also good predictors of **area burned**.


### Seasonal Severity Rating

The Seasonal Severity Rating (SSR) is the mean DSR over the extended summer, from June to September. The SSR explains 45% of the interannual **variance in area burned** in Portugal.

In some years there were large differences between the observed and predicted values, this means that variables, other than mean SSR, played an important role. Those variables could be Extreme DSR values over short periods of time, and Area burned in previous few years.

In years with low %90SSR (percentage of days during the fire season where fire spread potential in the top 10%) (less than 13 days), with a cool, humid summer the burned area is never high. 
In years with high %90SSR (more than 20 days), with a hot, dry summer, the burned area is never low. 
In years with intermediate %90SSR (between 13 and 20 days), with a moderate summer, the burned area can vary widely. Here some factors other than meteorology may be more important (the accumulated burned area of the previous 5 years and the availability of large stretches of land with high fuel loadings)
