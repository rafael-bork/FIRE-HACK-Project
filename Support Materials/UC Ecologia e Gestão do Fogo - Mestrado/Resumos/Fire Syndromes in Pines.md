Fire-related traits of Mediterranean pines:
- height, 
- self-pruning of dead branches, 
- thick bark, 
- seedling regeneration, 
- needle characteristics, 
- cone serotiny,

### Fire tolerator R+S-
*Pinus nigra, Pinus pinaster*
- Thick bark
- **Self-pruning**
- Protected buds that survive understory fires.
- Long thin needles
- Frequent burning of the understory
- Low intensity fires
- Polypyric lifecycle
- Iteroparous reproduction cycle

### Fire embracer R-S+
*Pinus halepensis, Pinus brutia*
- Early reproduction (Slow-growth)
	- Fast replacement of the seed bank
	- They avoid Immaturity risk
- Hot-flammable strategy
	- Retention of dead branches
	- Canopy-stored serotinous seed bank
- Obligate Seeders
- Synchronous and fire-dependent recruitment
- Monopyric lifecycle
- Semelparous reproduction cycle

### Fire avoider R-S-
*Pinus sylvestris, Pinus unicata*
- Occupy landscapes with low fire incidence
- They lack fire-adaptive traits
- Fire independent lifecycle
- Iteroparous reproduction cycle

### Fire refugia R-S-
- Live in fire-prone ecosystems but survive in parts of the landscape with limited fuel loads
