### Fire Intensity $I_B\ (kW/m)$
Rate of heat release, the quantity of heat released per unit of time in the flame front.
$$I_B=h\ w\ r\ (kW/m)$$
$h$ - fuel heat content ($kJ/kg$)
$w$ - fuel consumed ($kg/m^2$)
$r$ - fire rate of spread ($m/s$)

The fuel consumed, $w$, can be calculated by comparing the pre-fire fuels in the site and the post-fire fuels (charcoal, ashes, powders).

Fire intensity quantifies the energy output of a fire front per unit length, helping to describe how hot and destructive a fire is. It’s crucial for understanding its potential impacts on vegetation, structures, and soil. It also helps fire managers assess suppression difficulty and safety risks.

#### Fire Characteristics Curve
The FCC expresses the relation between $w$, fire consumed, and $r$, fire rate of spread. In this graph we can draw isolines of Fire Intensity, where all the points in each line have the same fire intensity value.

The figure assumes a fuel heat content of 18.000 kJ/kg

The red X represents a cured grass fire, that has high $r$ (spread very fast) and low $w$ (consume little fuel), and the blue X represents a logging slash fire, that has a low $r$ (spread more slowly) but high $w$ (consume large quantities of fuel). Both of these scenarios have the same fire intensity.


### Flame Length

![[Flame Lenght.png|200]]

Flame length can be useful to estime the Fireline Intensity  without having to measure rate of spread and the consumed fuel (which is only possible after the fire, and in that case the calculations wouldn't be very timely done), using only a visual estimation of flame length.
$$I_B=273\ L_f^{2.17}$$
$I_B$ - fireline intensity ($kW/m$)
$L_f$ - flame length ($m$)
