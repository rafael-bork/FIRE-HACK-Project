### Fuel Loading ($W$)
the dry weight mass of the fuelbed per unit area. It is reported in dry weight to eliminate the effect of variable fuel moisture content, which can vary substantially over a fire season.
$$W=\frac{m_{dry}}{A}\ (kg/m^2)$$

The is one of the most important fire intensity indicators.


### Fuel Layer Depth ($\delta$)
Fuel layer depth is the thickness of the surface fuel layer. Traditionally, it is calculated by envisioning a virtual sheet laid over the top of the surface fuel layer and visually estimating the average height of that sheet.



### Fuelbed Volume ($V$)
The calculation of Fuelbed Volume may be performed in different ways:
1. from an estimate of depth across the fuelbed unit area;
2. for a individual plant or particle;
3. as an integrated average fuel layer depth.

### Bulk Density ($\rho_b$)
The bulk density of a fuel component is the mass of the fuel component material divided by the volume of space it occupies.
$$\rho_b=\frac{m_{fuel\ component}}{V_{fuel\ component}}\ kg/m^3$$

$$W=\frac{m_{dry}}{A}=\frac{\rho_b\ V_{fuel\ component}}{A}=\frac{\rho_b\ A_{fuel\ component}\ \delta}{A}=\frac{\rho_b\ A\ {\%cover}\ \delta}{A}={\rho_b\ {\%cover}\ \delta}$$


### Packing Ratio ($\beta$)
The packing ratio is an index of fuelbed compactness that accounts for the damping effect of fuel layer looseness or compression on combustion.
$$\beta=\frac{\rho_b}{\rho_{particle}}\ (\ )$$

 In a very porous, loose fuelbed (lower $\beta$) heat is lost in transmission between fuel particles, while a very compact (higher $\beta$) is poorly oxygenated. Both extremes lead to sub-optimal combustion conditions, and reduced rate of fire spread and fire intensity.
