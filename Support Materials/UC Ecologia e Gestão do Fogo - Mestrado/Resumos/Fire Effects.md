### Severity
Severity is a term that describes ecosystem responses to fire, therefore is context-specific and  is not quantified by a single quantitative measure. Despite depending on the quantity and rate of heat release by the fire, there is not a clear relationship between fire intensity and fire severity



They can be direct (e.g., combustion of biomass) or indirect (e.g., changes in nutrient cycling, species composition, or landscape structure over time).

Fires have numerous direct and indirect effects that impact the region:
1. Loss of Vegetation Cover
2. Soil Erosion
3. Increased Sediment Deposition
4. Nutrient Transport
5. Algae Blooms

6. Air Pollution
7. Reduced Solar Radiation
8. Black Carbon Deposition

9. Localized Rainfall 
10.  Post-fire Flooding
11. Post Fire Debris Flow 
12. Export of nutrients from the site 

13. Creation of soot
14. transport by atmospheric currents
15. deposit in snowy areas
16. Alteration of soil colour
17. lower albedo
18. increased rate of melting

19. Pyrolysis of biomass
20. Deposit of charred particles
21. Formation of a subsurface hydrophobic layer
22. (in sloped places) if there is high runoff, there is landslide risk


### Fire Effects on Soils
- **Physical properties**
	- Soil Structure  
		- In the A horizon is strongly determined by OM
		- In the B horizon depends on the clay minerals and the composition of the cation exchange complex
	- Soil texture (clays)
		- At 500ºC there is a fusion and collapse of the clay particles in the soil
	- Total Porosity/Bulk Density
		- The collapse of soil structure reduces its total porosity.
	- Pore Size distribution
		- The loss of macropores in the top horizon hinders water infiltration and increases surface runoff. Loss of soil structure
		- Changes in porosity also impair the soil’s ability to retain water.
	- Density of aggregates
		- At 300ºC we observe a breakdown of the soil aggregates
	- Colour
		- It darkens, due to charring, and reddens, due to formation of iron oxides
	- Temperature
		- It changes because of the disappearance of the vegetable mantle and the darkening of ground (decreased albedo)
- **Chemical properties**
	- Organic matter (OM)
		- Starting as 200ºC, as the OM's temperature gets higher we see a gradual loss of OM and later volatile compounds, transforming into carbon residues, which are lost after ignition.
		- The rate of OM loss is very high because it is mainly found in the upper levels of the soil, where the fire heats up the soil the most
		- The heating of OM at the soil surface can cause strong hydrophobicity, which hinders water infiltration (**Water Repellence**).
		- The absence of organic matter leas to less soil particle aggregates, making it less porous and hindering the eluviation of ash
	- Cation exchange capacity 
		- It decreases proportionally to the loss of organic matter
	- Base Saturation
		- increases as a consequence of the prevailing release of bases from the combusting organic matter
	- pH
		- They tend to increase because of the release of the alkaline cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na) bound to the organic matter
		- Higher pH levels will result in the immobilization of Phosphor, blocking their absorption to the plants.
	- Nutrient recycling
		- Biological Decomposition is substituted by instantaneous thermal decomposition (pyrolysis)
	- **Nutrient** storage (Nutrient changes are directly linked to the ecosystem's NPP)
		- Many nutrients' and some cations' forms (Ca, Mg, Na get oxidized mainly) and concentrations are affected by the fire. 
			- Direct volatilization into the atmosphere during the fire (N, C).
			- Loss of particulate material in smoke (P and Cations).
			- Mineralization of composts (N, P)
			- Immediately after a fire there is ash deposition and increase of nutrient content due to nutrient mineralization and formation of stable forms (black carbon, charcoal, apatite) that are resistant to decomposition.
			- Surface runoff and transport of nutrients.
			- Leaching of nutrients into and through the soil profile
			- In situ nutrient retention in partially burned vegetation.
		- In the long term the soil nutrient content usually decreases because of
			1. nutrient volatilization, 
			2. transformation of the nutrients to more recalcitrant forms
			3. ash removal by wind and surface runoff.
		- Frequent fires can hinder vegetation recovery and foster land degradation and desertification due to lower Soil Organic Carbon and N content. Therefore, nitrogen richness and ecosystem productivity can be used as predictive indicators of an ecosystem’s potential for recovery after fire.
- **Biological Properties**
	- Microbial Biomass
		- It decreases and their recovery depends on the promptness of plant recolonisation
	- Composition of microbial community
		- Changes as a consequence of the selective effect of fire and the modification of the vegetation;
	- Soil-dwelling invertebrates biomass
		- decreases but not a lot, thanks to their higher mobility 
	- Composition of Soil-dwelling invertebrates community
		- it changes.



The **Threshold Temperature** is the temperature at which nutrients are volatilized and irreversible damage occurs to a particular soil property.
- Insensitive soil properties - Tt = 450ºC
	- Clays, Cations and other minerals
- Moderately sensitive soil properties - Tt = 100ºC ~ 400ºC
	- Sulphur, Organic Matter and other properties that depend upon it
- Sensitive soil properties - Tt $\leq$ 100
	- Living microorganisms ( bacteria, fungi, mycorrhizae), Plant roots, Plants seeds, Biologically mediated nutrient cycling

The clay minerals tolerate high temperatures without suffering irreversible damage, therefore the  fire will not affect greatly the B horizon of the soil, where they are mainly found.



### Fire Effects on Water

Less Rainfall Interception due to vegetation loss causing more erosion from the rain
More water can reach the soil intensifying the hydrological response
Less infiltration due to soil water repellency, especially after high-intensity fires
Less infiltration due to lower porosity from ash deposits
Less infiltration due to reduced macroporosity from degradation of soil structure
More infiltration after smaller fires due to the removal of litter without affecting soil properties
More surface runoff due to reduced interception and infiltration causing enhanced nutrient losses associated with transport of ash, charcoal, soil particles and dissolved nutrients
Less evapotranspiration due to canopy loss and vegetation mortality
More soil erosion due to exposed soil and increased runoff.
More streamflow due to reduced evapotranspiration and enhanced runoff.
Less water quality due to increases in sediment, nutrients (N, P, …), and ash in the water
No changes in soil moisture
Eutrophication of water bodies due to nutrient transportation causing deterioration of chemical and biological water quality



### Fire Effects on Plants

Plant cells die at 50ºC
Plant cells can die at lower temperatures if exposed during longer times
Meristems and buds are much more sensitive to heat.
	They are more sensitive when they are actively growing and their moisture is high
Plant mortality depends on the amount of meristematic tissues killed

Fire behavior, fire duration, the pattern of fuel consumption, and the amount of subsurface heating influence temperature of the tissue and the duration of exposure (Smouldering fire), and therefore determine heat it receives and the likelihood of it being killed, and their recovery.

Woody plant’s structure affects the probability that the aboveground portion will be killed by fire. 
 - Branch density,
 - Ratio of live to dead crown material,
 - Height/Location of the base of the crown with respect to surface fuels,
	 - Self-pruning
 - Total crown size
 - Twig Size
 - Bud Size
 - Needle length (conifers) to protect the buds
 - Dormant season (Deciduous trees)
 - Bark thickness to protect the stems and the cambial layer (Eucalyptus)
 - Stand basal area
 - Trunk Diameter
 - Stand Age (Regular?) and Structure
 - Dominant Trees
 
Bole heating - Heat is conducted through the bark of trees (bark is a poor conductor it insulates the live cambium underneath)
