Water exists in the cells of dead fuels as:
- **Bound Water** inside the cell walls through H-bonding to holo-cellulose molecules (30%)
- **Free Water** in the cell's lumens, not bound to any molecules (70%)

##### Fiber Saturation Point 
The Fiber Saturation Point is the amount of moisture the cell has where there cell wall is saturated but there is no free water in the cell lumen. The FSP is around 30% of the total moisture content.
Below 30%, all the water tin the cell is bound water, only if it excedes 30% that free water is present.

The free water is easier to remove from he cell, therefore, it is the extracted first and more rapidly than bound water.

##### Equilibrium Moisture Content
Is the moisture level at which the wood neither gains nor loses moisture, since it is at equilibrium with the relative humidity and temperature of the surrounding environment, therefore it changes throughout the day.


### Fuel Drying 
The Fuel Drying Timelag is the time required for a dead fuel to lose $1 − 1/𝑒 = 63\%$ of the difference between its initial MC and the EMC at a constant $T_{air}=27ºC$ and $RH_{air}=20\%$, in hours.

The faster initial drying rate corresponds to the easier removal of free water, followed by slower rates associated with the removal of bound water

Timelag depends primarily on fuel particle [[Fuel Particle Properties#Surface-to-Volume Ratio ($ sigma$)|S/V ratio]] ($\sigma$) , which can be estimated from the [[Fuel Particle Properties#Particle Diameter ($d$)|particle diameter]] of dead woody fuels.

Small fuels dry out rapidly and respond more quickly to short-term variability in ambient RH, while large fuels require much longer dry periods to reach similar dryness.

Dead fuel MC depends on this weather variables:
- Rainfall 
- Wind 
- Air temperature 
- Air relative humidity
