#FEM 

A fuel model is a simplified description of vegetation meant for use in a mathematical model of fire behaviour; it is a set of numbers that describe the fuel for the model

**Fuel classification** entails three tasks: 
- Characterization: identification of the key physical and chemical parameters to describe fuel particles, fuelbeds and fuel complexes. 
- Inventory: measurement or sampling of the characterization parameters. 
- Evaluation: estimation of ignition likelihood and potential fire behaviour of the inventoried fuel.


### Fuel Models

There are 18 fuel models developed by Prof. P. Fernandes (UTAD) to describe the four major fuel structural groups present in Portugal:
- 4 Litter ($F$)
- 7 Mixed litter / other forest understory vegetation ($M$)
- 5 Opens shrubland and shrub understory ($V$)
- 2 Grasslands ($D$)

The definition of the main structural fuel model groups is based on the identification of the strata most responsible for the spreading of a flame front.

##### F-RAC
Densely packed litter of short needle conifers.
##### F-PIN
Needle litter of pine stands with intermediate length to long needles
##### F-FOL
Densely packed litter of evergreen and deciduous hardwoods.
##### F-EUC
Eucalypt (E. globulus) leaf litter
##### M-PIN
Pine litter, average to long needles and shrub understory
##### M-CAD
Deciduous hardwood litter with shrub understory containing abundant live fuels.
##### M-ESC
Sclerophyll hardwood litter, with shrub understory
##### M-EUC
Eucalypt litter with shrub understory
##### M-EUCd
Eucalypt patchy litter, with or w/out shrub understory along plantation rows: young or recently
##### M-H
Litter, with grass understory: forest stands, regardless of species
##### M-F
Litter, with bracken fern understory: forest stands, regardless of tree species
##### V-MAb
Low shrubs (<1 m) with abundant dead and/or fine fuel
##### V-MMb
Low shrubs (<1 m), with little dead fuel and/or relatively thick foliage
##### V-MAa
Tall shrubs (>1 m) with abundant dead and/or fine fuel. Also as forest understory in open or young stands, regardless of tree species.
##### V-MMa
Tall shrubs (>1 m), with little dead fuel and/or relatively thick foliage
##### V-MH
Short(< 1 m), green, often patchy shrubs, with grasses. Young shrublands, up to three years since the last fire.
##### V-Hb
Short grass (<0,5 m)
##### V-Ha
Tall grass (> 0,5 m)
