### Soil Protection (reduction of erosion risk)

Erosion intensity depends on:
- topography (slope grade and length), 
- rainfall intensity, 
- soil erodibility (related to soil properties),
- **plant cover** (including litter),
- artificial erosion control measures (slope terracing)

Wildfires promote erosion through the increased surface runoff because of the:
- burning of the vegetative layer
- loss of organic matter
- heating of the soil's top layer

Erosion effects
- Direct soil heating
- Loss of protective vegetation cover
- Export of soil nutrients
- Loss of soil productivity
- Reduction of soil porosity
- Promotion of flooding
- Offsite deposition of water-borne silt
- Soil loss (if it excedes soil formation rate)

The map of **susceptibility to erosion** combines stream power index (watershed area and slope gradient) and fire severity.

After summer fires there is a high erosion risk right after the fire, when plant cover is low and heavy rains tend to occur.



## Slope treatments
Stabilization of the burned areas preventing/mitigating the fire effects through:
- Mulching
- Erosion barriers
- Scarification
- Slash spreading
- Planting and seeding
- Control of invasive species
- Protection of special sites and habitats

##### Mulching
Mulching involves spreading a layer of material (such as straw, wood chips, or shredded bark) over burned soil to protect it from erosion, retain moisture, and promote vegetation recovery.
- reduce erosion
- reduce surface flow
- reduce downstream peak flows
- reduce loss of nutrients
- reduce soil crusting
- reduce soil compactation
- increase infiltration
- allows for the pre wetting of water repellent soil
- securing of soil seed bank
- moisture and temperature stabilization, great for seed germination and growth.

##### Log Erosion Barriers
A physical barrier made from felled logs placed across a slope after a wildfire to help control erosion. It works by slowing down water flow, trapping sediments, and reducing soil erosion and runoff on burned slopes.
- reduce soil degradation
- reduce soil erosion
- shortening of slope length
- increased surface roughness
- improved infiltration
- increased trapped sediment



### Salvage logging
Harvesting of commercially valuable dead or damaged trees. Timber value continuously decreases as time passes after fire because of the wood decay, thus this needs to be decided as soon as possible to maximize economic benefit.

Advantages
- generates economic benefit
- to avoid pests
- avoids damage to regenerated pines
Disadvantages
- decreased seedling growth
- reduced biodiversity
- the dragging of the logs may cause soil degradation and erosion

Therefore there should be salvage logging in non-vulnerable soils and in patches to optimize biodiversity, while monitoring weakened trees for pest outbreaks. The branches can also be used to produce mulching material. 


### Forest Restoration or Conversion?
Forest conversion could be considered for breaking the horizontal continuity in homogeneous forests (fire management planning).

#### Forest Restoration
**Indirect restoration** - Natural restoration
- Lower costs
- Higher plant survival
- Increased growth rate
**Active restoration** - Planting or seeding
- low cost/effectiveness (acquiring seedlings, preparation, …)
- Soil preparation may increase soil erosion risk
- High seeding mortality
- Should be considered only when other options are not feasible

The decision of opting by active or natural restoration will be constrained by the type of pre-fire vegetation, the ecosystem response to fire, and the objectives for the burned area.


Postfire restoration must maximize plant establishment and growth by:
- using local seed sources (or other better places because of the changing conditions)
- coming from good quality stands
- having the appropriate traits to persist under the expected fire regimes.
- emulating the structure of fire-tolerant forests (in fire-embracer species)


### Herbivory management
They reduce the fuel load and fire hazard for example in fuel breaks, or in areas at the wildland-urban interface

**Browsers** consume woody species (shrubs and tree branches), e.g. goats or deer
**Grazers**, consume mostly herbaceous vegetation e.g. cows or sheep

Herbivory can be a limiting factor when there is the regeneration of burned areas. There also may be consumption of the terminal buds, essential to their growth.

It may be necessary to invest in the protection of regenerating/planted plants.


### Alien species
*Acacia spp., Hakea spp., Ailanthus spp.*
They may be promoted by the fire occurrence and may
- become invasive and endanger the regeneration of native vegetation.
- be more fire hazardous, creating a feedback loop where fire promotes invasive species

Fire does not seem to promote the occurrence of exotic plants in most of the Mediterranean ecosystems, as these systems are rather resilient to disturbance, but in some moister areas they are becoming an increasing problem for post-fire management.


### Pests and Diseases
they interact with wildfires through these mechanisms:
- Tree weakness/mortality caused by the wildfires can promote of insect/pathogen populations. 
- Tree weakness/mortality caused by these agents' actions can lead to dead fuel accumulation and increased fire hazard. (e.g. pines and *Scolytidae spp.*)
