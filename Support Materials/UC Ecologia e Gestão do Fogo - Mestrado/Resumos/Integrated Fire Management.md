Southern Europe has seen an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme wildfire events. These are the identified causes

**Demographic changes**
- Migration from rural to urban areas has led to land abandonment.
- Loss of the active management of landscapes that reduced fuel loads
- Expansion of wildland–urban interfaces (WUIs) has increased fire ignition risk and vulnerability.

**Land Use Changes**
- Agricultural abandonment and Reduced land-use diversity has turned the landscapes into shrublands and young forests, increasing fuel continuity and available biomass.
- Afforestation and reforestation often involving flammable species 

**Climate Change**
- Longer and hotter summers have extended fire seasons and dried fuels more thoroughly.
- Reduced and erratic rainfall that leads to frequent droughts and the changing precipitation patterns, increasing vegetation stress and flammability.
- Increased frequency of extreme weather events that contribute to rapid fire spread and difficulty in containment.

**Changes in Fire Use and Policy**
- Decades of fire suppression policies have led to fuel build-up.
- Abandonment or restriction of pastoral burning and agricultural burning, once used to control vegetation.
- Delayed response to fuel accumulation using prescribed burning and fuel reduction treatments


## Fire Management
Fire management is the process of planning, preventing and suppressing fires to protect people, property, forests, and other ecosystems.

### Fire Exclusion Paradigm
Traditionally, Portugal’s wildfire policy has relied predominantly on fire suppression, it assumes fire is inherently destructive and should be eliminated from all landscapes as quickly as possible.

### Fire Paradox
However, the **Fire Exclusion Paradigm** relies on systematic fire suppression without adequate fuel reduction and landscape management, this leads to fuel accumulation over time. So that, when a fire occurs and is not rapidly dealt with, the built-up fuels create conditions for very large, high-severity wildfires.
Due to this shift in the fire regime, the total burned area concentrates in fewer, more extreme fires, that require even more resources to control (**Firefighting Trap**).

Suppression Policies vs Prevention Policies
- less Fire Duration
- higher fuel loads
- higher and more volatile rate of forest burning

Therefore, the policies must take into account an appropriate balance of suppression and prevention efforts can greatly reduce yearly and total burned area.



## Integrated Fire Management
It is a concept for planning and operational systems with the objective of minimizing the damage and maximizing the benefits of fire, including a combination of prevention and suppression strategies.

In this, not all fire is thought as 'bad', it envolves
- the regulation of traditional burning, reducing inappropriate use
- using prescription fires as land management tool, with conditions that make it safe

Integrated fire management envolves 3 dimensions
- Fire Ecology - fire prevention, fire suppression and fire use
- Fire Culture - considering the socioeconomic necessities and the impacts
- Fire Management - evaluating the key ecological attributes of fire

The **National Plan for Integrated Rural Management** defends that we must
- Enhance the value of rural areas
- Better care of rural areas
- Change our current behaviours
- Manage fire risk efficiently
