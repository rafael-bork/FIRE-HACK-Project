#FEM 

Due to climate change:
- The mean air temperature in the month of August are tending to increase
- The precipitation in the month of May is tending to decrease

	- There is an increase in extreme weather events and a new possibility of more extreme weather events (heatwaves, floods, etc.)

**Heatwave** - A heatwave occurs when over an interval of at least 6 consecutive days, the daily maximum temperature exceeds by at least 5ºC the daily mean maximum temperature value for the reference period (1970 – 2000)


### Extreme Wildfire Events
Extreme wildfire events display much higher rates of heat release and it is transferred mainly by convection.

Fire behavior characteristics with potential to have major impacts on people and assets are fireline intensity (FLI), rate of spread (ROS), spotting, and the sudden change of fire behavior.

The most complete definition of EWE focuses on physical factors of fire behavior that influence suppression capacity, considering that:
- the greatest likelihood of adverse social impacts is when response abilities are overwhelmed; 
- suppression abilities are a social variable that can, to a large degree, be assessed consistently across contexts; and
- the physical dynamics that influence fire behavior are the same around the world.

The extreme wildfire events can be:
- **wind-driven fires**, when it gets oxygen from the wind
- **plume-driven fires**, when it gets oxygen from the convection currents from combustion itself (positive feedback)

##### Power of the Wind $P_w$
The rate of flow of kinetic energy through a vertical plane of unit area at a specified height, in a neutrally stable atmosphere (there is a vertical thermal gradient of -9.8ºC/km of height above the surface).

##### Power of the Fire $P_f$
the rate at which thermal energy is converted to kinetic energy at a given height in the convection column.


If $P_f/P_w\geq1$ for at least 300m above the fire, there is a high probability of a [[Fire Behaviour#Blow-up Fire|blow-up fire]].
