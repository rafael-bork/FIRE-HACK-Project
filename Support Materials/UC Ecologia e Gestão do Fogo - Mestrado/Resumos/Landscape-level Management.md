Coordinate and consolidate treatments (mechanical, prescribed burn, managed wildfire) to reduce fuels and restore fire’s ecosystem function

### Reduce Fuel Loads
Decrease the amount of combustible material available to burn through thinning, prescribed burning, grazing, …

### Alter Fuel Structure
- Modify vertical fuel continuity to reduce crown fire risk
- Modify horizontal fuel continuity to compartmentalize the landscape

### Create Fuelbreaks and Defensible Spaces
Slow fire spread and facilitate suppression operations by creating strips of modified fuels, often located near roads, ridgelines, or built assets.

### Strategic Location of Treatments
Maximize landscape-level effectiveness by using fire behavior modelling and historical fire data to identify high-risk areas.

### Creation of Landscape Mosaics and Promotion of Pyrodiversity
Increase spatial heterogeneity in fuels and vegetation types to reduce the potential for large, high-intensity fires.

### Integration with Land Use and Conservation Goals
Balance fire prevention with ecological and social values focussing on collaborative planning.

### Adaptive Management and Monitoring
Track effectiveness of fuel treatments over time and adjust strategies based on the outcomes.


### Main types of landscape-scale fuel treatment

##### Strategic fuelbreaks
Strips of reduced fuel load that are placed on ridgelines and cover large areas. They aim at containing the spread of large wildfires and facilitating their suppression. 
##### Perimetral fuelbreaks
Areas of reduced fuel load that are narrower, around urban areas and infrastructure. Designed to protect localized, valuable assets.
##### Patch mosaics
Small to medium-sized dynamic areas of varied shapes, where there is fuel treatment to reduce horizontal continuity, and therefore, fire rate of spread, intensity, and severity. These need to be recreated yearly but can be applied at a fraction of the available area.

###### Fuel Treatment Patches
The pattern is a sort of hybrid between linear fuelbreaks and patch burns, that hinders fire spread over historically fire-prone areas.
Burn patches are not supposed to have fixed positions, the mosaic changes in space and time every year.


Fuelbreaks slow fire spread along key corridors, enabling fire fighters to intervene. Patch treatments alter fire behavior across the broader landscape, reducing the likelihood that fires will reach fuelbreaks with high intensity. They enable risk reduction without homogenizing the landscape.




### Primary Fuelbreak Network
The Primary Fuelbreak Network (PFN) was designed to reduce the area affected by large wildfires. It facilitates direct fire suppression by creating favourable conditions for firefighting operations at strategically selected locations along ridges.

They do not need to be totally cleared of vegetation and may even have tree cover in the outside parts, however at very low density (**shaded fuelbreaks**), creating a fuel load gradient. 
Shaded fuelbreaks typically result from thinning a forest stand and have economic and aesthetic advantages.

### Secondary Fuelbreak Network
The Secondary Fuelbreak Network (SFN) is a perimetral network of cleared or managed vegetation strips designed to reduce wildfire intensity and to slow fire spread, near areas at risk like towns, critical infrastructure, or important natural areas, helping protect people, houses, roads, powerlines, and other infrastructure.
